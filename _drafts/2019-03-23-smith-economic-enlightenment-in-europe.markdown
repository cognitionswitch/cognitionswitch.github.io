In Book 3 of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith explains the evolution of Europe from a collection of feudal states to the modern European states of the eighteenth century. Smith highlights economic incentives and profit motives as the most important factors underlying political and economic development of Europe. 

##### **Towns and Cities**
In towns and cities, cooperative incentives between the sovereign and the burghers, both aligned against the landed nobility of the surrounding country, motivated political and economic changes throughout Europe. 

Tax revenues due to the sovereign were “let in farm” to burghers in local towns over which those taxes were levied; that is, the burghers could collect and retain tax revenues in their own towns. In exchange, the burghers would pay a fixed annual rent to the sovereign. Civil liberties were also extended to burghers in exchange for political capital and military assistance against the nobility, a social class often at odds with both the sovereign and the burghers of local towns. These civil liberties included the right to dispose of property and some rights of self government. The ability to both accumulate revenue and the security in and right to dispose of property acted as a stimulus to the accumulation of capital. The attractive circumstances of the burghers encouraged migration from the country to the cities. 

Cities near sea coasts and navigable rivers could access markets independent of economic status; inland cities generally require markets to emerge organically through manufactures using raw materials from the surrounding country.    

##### **Rural and Country Regions**
Smith cites three factors that influenced the political and economic development of the country. First, the economic improvement of the towns created markets for the raw produce of the country. Second, members of the merchant class that emerged in the towns began to migrate into the country; the habits and ambitions of the merchant class oriented them towards the improvement of land and the advancement of agriculture. Third, greater security in property provided the most important incentive towards the economic improvement of the country.

The manufactures that developed in towns produced goods that could be exchanged for the raw produce of the country; and the development of towns also opened up channels to foreign markets. The widening array of available goods allowed landed nobility to exchange the excess produce of the land for the acquisition of manufactures and opulence. Prior to these opportunities, nobility lavished the excess produce upon retainers and tenants within their dominion; when the nobility directed that produce instead towards their own enrichment, the tenants were no longer obliged to servile loyalty towards the nobility. Further, market opportunities now induced landowners towards the improvement of land, a development that tenants would not undertake without stronger guarantees against private property and longer leases. In order to achieve higher rents, landowners gave up feudal law for the civil liberties required by tenants to ensure security in their persons and property.
